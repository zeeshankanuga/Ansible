# Inventory 

Ansible inventory file is a fundamental component of Ansible that defines the hosts (remote systems) that you want to manage and the groups those hosts belong to. The inventory file can be static (a simple text file) or dynamic (generated by a script). It provides Ansible with the information about the remote nodes to communicate with during its operations.

### INI Format

```
# inventory file: hosts

[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[dbservers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com

[all:vars]
ansible_user=admin
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key
```

## Usage

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory <Adhoc command or Playbook.yml>

ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all
```
